### Txtrevise text editing tool
Latest release: v.1.0 (Win32 2009/04/06), Implemented in Python, Targeting: Windows and Unix-like desktop platforms

Txtrevise is a command line text editing tool, designed for quickly replacing text on a specific line in a chosen file. 
It is a much neater rewrite of a tool that I previously wrote in C++, called revise.

Also reimplemented in Perl. 2011.
Also reimplemented in Ruby gem with API. 2011. ;)

Installing
----------

On [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) and its [derivatives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Ubuntu-based), you can install txtrevise from its Launchpad PPA on the terminal using `apt-get` with:

* `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:s.stpettersen/txtrevise-util`
* `sudo apt-get update`
* `sudo apt-get install txtrevise`

For the Perl implementation, use `txtrevisepl`.

If you want the Ruby gem, just use:

`[sudo] gem install txtrevise`

TODO
----

* Fix PPA for Trusty Tahr and Utopic Unicorn.
