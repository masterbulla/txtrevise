### Txtrevise text editing tool
Latest release: v.1.0 (Win32 2009/04/06), Implemented in Python, Targeting: Windows and Unix-like desktop platforms

Txtrevise is a command line text editing tool, designed for quickly replacing text on a specific line in a chosen file. 
It is a much neater rewrite of a tool that I previously wrote in C++, called revise.

Also reimplemented in Perl. 2011.
